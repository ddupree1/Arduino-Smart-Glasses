In this project, I designed and developed a cutting-edge prototype of smart glasses tailored for runners, integrating advanced functionalities to monitor essential metrics such as running distance, time, and pace. Utilizing the Arduino Nano microcontroller in conjunction with the NEO-6M GPS module, I crafted a seamless solution for real-time tracking. Employing the Arduino IDE and harnessing the power of C++ programming, I meticulously coded and debugged the system, employing a principled approach to problem-solving. Additionally, I skillfully soldered components to enable wireless functionality, ensuring enhanced usability and freedom of movement for the user.
